# Vision Disability Filter Camera
## Learn more about the symptoms of eye diseases by experiencing them with camera filters

This playground allows you to play around with various filters which simulate symptoms of various
vision-related diseases. At the bottom of the screen, you will find many filtersâ€”much like you would
see in Instagram Stories' camera or Snapchat. Try enabling some and see what happens!

###### Each filter represents a symptom caused by various eye diseases. For example: the colorblind filter turns your camera display into a grayscale image.

- Experiment:
Using these filters, you can get some idea of what it's like to have **Achromatopsia**, the eye disease
I have in which you see with only your rods. Here are the filters to try combining:

  - ![Near Sighted](DistanceCV@2x.png) Near-Sighted
  - ![Light Sensitive](Light@2x.png) Light Sensitive
  - ![Colorblind](Colorblind@2x.png) Fully Colorblind

If you want to save your filtered picture, simply press the capture button above the filters. From there,
you can preview your image, and save it to your camera roll!

Vision is often seen as one of the most critical senses, but it is important to understand that many people
see differently. These filters can help give you more perspective on what others may see. I hope you enjoy
experimenting with these filters, and can use them to better understand vision disabilities.
