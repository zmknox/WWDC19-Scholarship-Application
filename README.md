For this project, I built camera filters that show symptoms of various eye diseases in order to give people more perspective on what the vision of others is like.

The iOS Project is where most development was initially done, ported later to the PlaygroundBook.

Use the Xcode project to build a PlaygroundBook, which you can then run on an iPad.
